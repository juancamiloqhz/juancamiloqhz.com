Have you ever wondered why I have taken the trouble to create this website? To answer, I invite you to walk with me through this short story.

I'll tell you a little about who I am, where I come from, what are the motivations of my life and why this website is a great link in my path.

My name is Juan Camilo Quintero Hernández, I was born in Medellín, Colombia, in the year 1986. I am an engineer and entrepreneur with a great curiosity and passion for science, arts, great artistic shows and engineering. A passionate about learning and knowing the great secrets of the world and life, with a great purpose: to propose and provide solutions to great problems that afflict our current societies.

In my childhood, I already showed great interests in science, engineering, technology and the arts. I was interested in knowing how the world and things worked; from how combustion engines and other machines work, passing through how the internet and computers work, to know the latest and greatest scientific and technological discoveries, which have allowed us to advance and evolve as a society.

I spent most of my childhood dreaming of being older, and thus be able to enter a university where I could learn so many topics that I was passionate about. I wanted to know everything without exception, I wanted to know in depth how the most complex machines were made and how the world of the most advanced industries worked, in addition to how to apply science and engineering to develop and propose advanced solutions to complex problems.

Knowing my passions and interests, I started my studies in Mechanical Engineering at the age of 18. A beautiful time where I could learn in depth and first hand how technical systems (machines) are created and developed based on the application of physical principles.

During my studies, I met areas of engineering that were very exciting, such as programming, computational mechanics. Opening my mind even more with the wide possibilities that were in front of me. And although my great interest was to obtain all the knowledge related to Mechanical Engineering, I realized that I was also very interested in the great and new world of the internet, information technologies and the great technological companies that began to dominate the world.

I spent entire nights surfing the internet researching the topics that most interested me. I tried all the applications and web services I could find. I was interested in knowing the reality of the great companies of innovation and technology; how they made their products, and above all, what was the key to their success and how they managed to change our society.

I was fascinated by the great technological advances that were being made, and I wanted to be part of them. I wanted to be part of the great technological revolution that was taking place in the world, and I wanted to be part of the great technological companies that were changing the world.

With the title of Engineer, I started various studies: MBA to obtain knowledge about management and management of innovative and technology companies, in addition I started my studies in software engineering and development of web applications, in addition to starting studies in pyrotechnics and fireworks, becoming in very little time a professional pyrotechnician and chief of fire or shooting of large pyrotechnic shows certified by the French Ministry of Defense.

Here I started my career as an entrepreneur and creator of pyrotechnic and pyromusical shows, I also started my studies in web development and programming. I got a great experience as a show creator in France with the company [Ruggieri](https://ruggieri.fr) in several seasons, performing large traditional shows for the festivities of July 14 in a large number of French cities.

Some inconveniences in my personal and family life, made my career as a professional pyrotechnician have to temporarily stop, which was a great opportunity to start with another of my great dreams, the conception and creation of software companies, technology and innovation.

This brings us to the present, I am an entrepreneur with great dreams, software developer, co-founder of [Vibra.la](https://vibra.la) a startup in the real estate sector and real estate in Latin America, creator of great pyrotechnic and artistic shows, with a great passion for technology, art, science and history.

And here is where, after telling you a brief history of my life and interests, my training, where this website fits in.

This website is a great link in my path, a great opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with the world, to share my passions and interests, to share my great dreams and to share my great projects.

I want to share with you my great passion for science, technology, art, history, and everything that is related to the great and wonderful world that surrounds us.
